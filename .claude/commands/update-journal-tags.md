# Update Journal Tags

1. Read all contents of `journal/` that has format of `YYYY-MM-DD_some_name.md`.
2. Come up with a list of up to 20 tags that provides best structure to this corpus. If there are less than 20 documents, limit yourself with 5 tags.
3. Replace the front matter of each of the files with the list of tags that match this file.
4. Update `journal/PROGRESS.md` to list all entries chronologically.

### Format of front matter
```
---
tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2
    - ...
---
(content of the file)
```
