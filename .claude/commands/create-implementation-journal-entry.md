# Create Implementation Journal Entry

Write down a detailed implementation journal entry capturing:

- Concepts and design choices
- Architecture/data flows if needed
- Data models if present
- ASCII UX mockup when necessary
- Edge cases and how to test against them
- Testing plan
- Updates for `specs/` if they exist
- Phased implementation approach and completion criteria

Save the entry to `journal/YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>.md` where topic is derived from the subject matter.

If need clarification, ask questions.
