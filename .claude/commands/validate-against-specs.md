# Validate Against Specs

Analyse the current implementation (`packages/`) and check if it matches `specs/`.

Documents in `specs/` folder comprise definitive specification for how the software should work: its features, architecture, patterns, etc.

Ensure that what is implemented follows the spec accurately.

If you find divergence, reconfirm whether it happened because of an explicit design choice.
