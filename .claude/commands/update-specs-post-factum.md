# Update Specs Post Factum

Review the implementation (`packages/`, `docs/`) and decide if and how `specs/` should be updated.

Documents in `specs/` folder comprise definitive specification for how the software should work: its features, architecture, patterns, etc.

It might be that during the implementation, some design choices were made. If so, the specs should be updated to reflect reality.

While updating specs, update their refs (and refs on them.)
